# pretty-proxy

WIP proxy server & app for usage while developing / whatever. Right now it only has an interface using command line with the goal being a cross platform app that does a whole lot more than just display traffic.

## Setup
1. Clone this repo
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn start`
4. Set your computers wifi/ethernet to proxy traffic to port 5060
5. Do web things, see HTTP/HTTPS traffic
